# ConfigMyMac

## Getting started
You should look at [00_variables.sh](/MyMac/00_variables.sh) for the variables you might want to edit.  These dictate what is installed. Every step in the process is optional and you will be asked to continue before proceeding. You should also be warned before any prompts for sudo credentials. 

## How do I run this thing? 
After cloning the repo, and editing the variables as mentioned above you should do this: 

`cd ConfigMyMac/bin`

`./start.sh `
